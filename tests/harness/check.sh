# Boots one contained Umbriel per check in checks/, runs the check, kills everything it spawned, and asserts
# that instance exited cleanly. One instance per check is what makes a failure local: a check starts from the default
# config with no windows, no overview, and workspace 1 focused, so it asserts behaviour instead of maintaining hygiene
# for whatever runs next. Boot plus teardown measures about 80ms, under 4% of the suite, and it buys back the
# config-restore reloads and window-drain loops that shared-instance checks had to carry.
# Containment matters. A stock Umbriel start runs its built-in autostarts, and `dbus-update-activation-environment --systemd` would repoint the *caller's* session-wide WAYLAND_DISPLAY and UMBRIEL_SOCKET at this throwaway instance. Unsetting DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS makes both autostarts fail harmlessly.
# Usage: check.sh <path-to-umbriel-binary> [name-fragment ...] [-j N|--jobs N] [-v|--verbose] [-l|--list]
# Each name fragment selects every check whose name contains it, so several fragments run several checks. Without a
# fragment the whole suite runs. A failing check keeps its runtime directory (compositor and client logs) and prints it.
# Checks are independent instances, so they run several at a time. `-j` or CHECK_JOBS sets how many; the default stays
# well under the core count because a check that asserts animation timing is the first thing an overloaded box breaks.
# Reporting order stays the declaration order regardless of which check finishes first.

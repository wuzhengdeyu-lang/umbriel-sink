# Actions

Actions are the compositor's verbs. Bind one under `[keybinds]`, attach it to a
[hot corner](keybinds.md#hot-corners), or run it with `umbriel msg <action>`.
`umbriel msg --help` prints this same list, with the same wording and the same
grouping. See [Keybinds](keybinds.md) for chord syntax and [IPC](ipc.md) for the
socket behind `umbriel msg`, including the event stream that reports what an
action changed.

## Argument forms

An action takes at most one argument, appended after a colon. `<angle>` forms
are required, `[bracket]` forms are optional.

| Form | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `<cmd>` | Command line, run through the shell: `spawn:kitty` |
| `<name>` | Submap to enter; `submap:reset` leaves one level |
| `<workspace>[/<output>]` | Bare digits select a 1-based position, other text selects a name, and double quotes force a name; append `/output` to scope either form |
| `<window-id>` | Window id from `umbriel windows` |
| `[<window-id>]` | The same id; the bare action targets the focused window |
| `[<output>]` | Connector or monitor name. Bare `dpms-off` and `dpms-on` target every configured output |
| `[<scratchpad>]` | Scratchpad name. The bare form selects the implicit `default` scratchpad, which exists only when no named scratchpads are configured |
| `<fraction>` | `0.1` to `1.0` of the column extent, or of the usable area for a floating window |
| `<delta>` | Signed `-0.9` to `0.9`; the result clamps to `0.1` to `1.0` |
| `<scrolling\|dwindle\|master\|toggle>` | Layout mode for `workspace-set-layout`; `toggle` cycles scrolling, dwindle, master |
| `[skip-confirmation]` | `session-quit` only: quit without the on-screen confirmation |

## Windows

| Action | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `window-close:[<window-id>]` | Close the focused window, or the given window |
| `window-pull` | Restore the most recently sunk window |
| `window-sink` | Move the focused window into the workspace sink stack |
| `window-toggle-floating:[<window-id>]` | Float or tile the focused window, or the given window |
| `window-toggle-fullscreen` | Toggle fullscreen or exit a window covering the focus |
| `window-toggle-maximize` | Toggle full width for the focused column |
| `window-toggle-maximize-to-edges` | Toggle maximize without gaps, struts, or borders |
| `window-toggle-pinned` | Pin the focused window above other windows |

Sunk windows are presented as non-interactive, centered projections without
resizing the client. By default, the top entry uses 93% scale and 82% opacity,
the next entry uses 85% scale and 45% opacity, and deeper entries remain in the
logical stack but are not rendered. `[appearance.sink].visible_depth` and
`levels` can change this presentation without changing stack order. Pull animates
the projection back to its normal placement while other tiled windows make room;
the scrolling layout reveals the restored column during the same transition.
Pull does not hand focus or input to the live surface until the
required resize commit arrives; an unresponsive client falls back after a
bounded wait instead of blocking the compositor.

Fullscreen and maximize remain window states while an entry is sunk. Their
live scene and fullscreen backdrop do not become foreground owners; Pull
restores the current state through the normal layout path. Overview shows one
passive card for a sunk window, and explicitly selecting that card unwinds the
stack through the selected entry. Moving a workspace or evacuating an output
keeps sunk entries sunk and preserves each source stack's LIFO order.

## Scratchpad

Scratchpads are global named holding areas that roam between outputs.
[Scratchpads](scratchpad.md) covers their configuration, restoration rules, and
multi-output behavior.

| `scratchpad-toggle:[<scratchpad>]` | Show or hide the selected scratchpad windows |
| `window-move-to-scratchpad:[<scratchpad>]` | Move the focused window into a scratchpad |
| `window-restore-from-scratchpad:[<scratchpad>]` | Return a scratchpad window to its saved workspace |
| `window-toggle-scratchpad:[<scratchpad>]` | Move the focused window to or from a scratchpad |

## Workspaces

Selector resolution, including forced numeric names and `/output` qualifiers, is
described in [Workspace selectors](workspaces.md#workspace-selectors).

## Layout differences

Column and extent actions adapt to the active layout:

| Action group | Scrolling | Dwindle | Master |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Column movement | Reorders columns | Swaps neighboring tiles | Exchanges master and stack contents |
| Consume and expel | Joins or splits columns | Swaps directional neighbors | Moves between master and stack |
| Primary extent | Changes column width | Adjusts horizontal splits | Changes master fraction |
| Secondary extent | Changes a row | Adjusts vertical splits | Changes a row |
| Layout scrolling | Pans the strip | No effect | No effect |
| Master count | No effect | No effect | Moves a window between master and stack |

See [Layout](layout.md) for geometry, directions, and resizing behavior.

## Notes

- Output direction actions do not wrap. The `next` and `previous` variants do.
- Workspace `next`, `previous`, `move-up`, and `move-down` do not wrap.
- A whole-column move preserves order, proportions, and column extent.
- Moving a multi-window column into Dwindle creates separate tiles.
- Floating and pinned behavior is described in [Layout](layout.md) and
  [Scratchpads](scratchpad.md).
- An action unavailable in the active layout does nothing from a keybind and
  returns an explanatory error through `umbriel msg`.
- `spawn:` supplies an activation token so the launched application can request
  focus. Autostart commands do not receive one.
- Bare `session-quit` asks for confirmation. Use
  `session-quit:skip-confirmation` only when an immediate exit is intended.

# Umbriel

Umbriel is a Wayland compositor designed for daily use, with scrolling, dwindle, and master layouts, per-output
workspaces, window rules, blur, shadows, and fluid animations.

It runs independently and can be paired with [Noctalia](https://github.com/noctalia-dev/noctalia), which provides a
first-class desktop shell experience for Umbriel. Umbriel is built in C++23 on
[wlroots](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlroots) and `umbrielfx`, its own hard fork of
[SceneFX](https://github.com/wlrfx/scenefx). Xwayland support comes from
[xwayland-satellite](https://github.com/Supreeeme/xwayland-satellite), which must be
installed and on `PATH`. Portal screen capture and sharing is provided by
[xdg-desktop-portal-umbriel](https://github.com/noctalia-dev/xdg-desktop-portal-umbriel), an
xdg-desktop-portal backend for Umbriel.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Umbriel is young and actively evolving. It is usable today, but configuration keys, keybinds, and behavior may change
> between releases, and rough edges remain. Current defaults are opinions, not stability promises.

## Why Umbriel?

When people ask what Umbriel's selling point is, the honest answer is that there is no single killer feature. We were
simply disappointed with the choices available to us, so we built the compositor we wanted to live in. The plan is
not to conquer the world or take over the big names; it is to feel at home with something we have a say in, with less
friction. That is exactly how Noctalia came to life, and Umbriel is its compositor side.

To understand the values and philosophy guiding the project, read our [ethos](https://noctalia.dev/ethos).

## Features

- Scrolling, dwindle, and master layouts with per-workspace selection, width presets, animated navigation, and
  mouse-driven resizing and tiled reordering
- Independent workspaces per output, with hotplug support and configurable modes, positions, scales, and transforms
- Floating, pinned, and fullscreen windows with configurable placement, focus, sizing, opacity, and visual effects
- [Global named scratchpads](docs/user/scratchpad.md) for temporarily hiding
  window groups and summoning them on any output
- An animated overview, directional focus, configurable keybinds, submaps, and activation policy
- Blur, shadows, rounded corners, double borders, opacity, and animated position, size, and fade transitions
- Keyboard, pointer, touch, touchpad gestures, XKB configuration, and text-input-v3/input-method-v2 input method support
- [Restricted Wayland connections](docs/user/security.md) for sandbox engines through security-context-v1, with
  per-application protocol grants
- Layer shell, session locking, clipboard management, screen capture, output control, and gamma control
- X11 application support through xwayland-satellite, when xwayland-satellite is installed and on `PATH`
- Live-reloaded TOML configuration with diagnostics and includes, plus local IPC and runtime inspection commands
- Runs as a nested Wayland compositor inside an existing Wayland or X11 desktop for development, or directly on DRM
  for daily use

## Building

Distribution maintainers should also read [PACKAGING.md](PACKAGING.md) for the
installed layout, dependency notes, and config fallback.

The scene graph and renderer live in [`umbrielfx/`](umbrielfx/) and build as part of the tree.

### System build

Install a C++23 compiler, Meson, Ninja, pkg-config, wayland-scanner, and development packages for wlroots 0.20
(0.20.1 or newer), Wayland, xkbcommon, libinput, pixman, libdrm, EGL, GLES2, GBM, lcms2, Cairo, Pango, tomlplusplus,
and nlohmann-json. Native `[drm]` GPU exclusions also require libudev. Then build Umbriel:

```sh
just release
just install
```

`jemalloc` is optional but recommended on glibc: it returns freed memory to the OS promptly and bounds heap
fragmentation in long-running sessions. Meson's `-Djemalloc=enabled` or `-Djemalloc=disabled` forces the choice; the
default (`auto`) uses it when the development package is installed and skips it otherwise (non-glibc libc builds
always skip it).

The binaries are written to `build-debug/umbriel` and `build-release/umbriel`.

### Nix

Build the package directly:

```sh
nix build
```

The resulting binary is available at `result/bin/umbriel`. For development, enter the project shell and use the same
Just recipes as a system build:

```sh
nix develop
just debug
```

### Testing

The development shell includes the clients and command-line tools used by the
test suite. Unit tests and the contained headless compositor harness are two
commands:

```sh
nix develop
just test                 # unit and umbrielfx suites, through Meson
just check                # every harness check
```

`just check` also takes name fragments, and `just check-names` lists them:

```sh
just check 310            # one check
just check 310 520        # several
just check overview       # every check in a group
just check 310 -v         # keep the full output of passing checks
just mode=asan check 310  # the same check against build-asan
```

Each check gets its own contained headless compositor, so a failure stays local
and checks run in any order. Every passing check emits a concise completion
message, summarized to a single dimmed line unless `-v` is enabled; failing
checks print their whole output. A failing check keeps its runtime directory
(compositor log, config, per-client logs) and prints the path.

## Running

Installed display-manager sessions start through `start-umbriel`. For supported
account shells, it loads the noninteractive login environment, then runs the
compositor as a user service on systemd or directly on other init systems.
Systemd sessions also inherit `environment.d`.

Start an installed native session from a TTY with:

```sh
start-umbriel
```

From an existing Wayland or X11 session, Umbriel opens a nested window (mod = Alt).
From a TTY it takes over the seat (mod = Super).

Apps that capture the screen through xdg-desktop-portal (browser screen sharing, OBS, portal-aware screenshot
tools) are served by [xdg-desktop-portal-umbriel](https://github.com/noctalia-dev/xdg-desktop-portal-umbriel), which
implements the Screencast and Screenshot interfaces for Umbriel.

```sh
just run debug kitty
```

Or run the binary directly:

```sh
./build-debug/umbriel -s kitty
```

Inside the session:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| mod+Escape | Quit (asks for confirmation) |
| mod+F1 | Cycle window focus |
| mod+H/J/K/L or arrows | Focus adjacent window |
| mod+Shift+H/J/K/L or arrows | Move focused window |
| mod+comma / mod+period | Consume left / consume right |
| mod+R / mod+F | Cycle width / toggle fullscreen |
| mod+T | Toggle floating for the focused window |
| mod+P | Toggle pin for the focused window |
| mod+O | Toggle the overview |
| mod+1..9 | Switch workspace on focused monitor |
| mod+Shift+1..9 | Move focused window to workspace and follow |

`kitty` is an optional startup command. Replace it with another command, or omit it by running `just run debug`
or `./build-debug/umbriel`. There is no default spawn keybind, so add one under `[keybinds]` (see
[`examples/config.toml`](examples/config.toml)) to open more terminals from inside the session, e.g. `"Mod+Return" = "spawn:kitty"`.

Stop with mod+Escape or `Ctrl+C` from the parent terminal.

## Configuration

Umbriel first checks `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/umbriel/config.toml`, then
`$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS`, and finally its packaged `share/umbriel/config.toml`.
These paths remain watched, so creating a higher-priority config switches to it
without a session restart. Pass `-c path/to/config.toml` to pin another file.
Config files can include files with
`[include] files = ["theme.toml", "keybinds.toml"]`; later files and the main
file override earlier values.

See [`examples/config.toml`](examples/config.toml) for the packaged starting configuration and
[`our online documentation`](https://docs.noctalia.dev/umbriel/) for the full reference.

### Nix (home-manager / NixOS)

Declarative configuration uses Nix attrsets serialized to TOML with `pkgs.formats.toml`.

```nix
# flake inputs
umbriel.url = "git+https://github.com/noctalia-dev/umbriel";

# NixOS
imports = [ inputs.umbriel.nixosModules.default ];
programs.umbriel.enable = true;

# home-manager
imports = [ inputs.umbriel.homeModules.default ];
programs.umbriel = {
  enable = true;
  settings = {
    general.autostart = [ "noctalia" ];
    layout.gap = 5;
    input.keyboard.layout = "de";
    keybinds = {
      "Mod+Return" = "spawn:kitty";
      "Mod+Q" = "window-close";
      "Mod" = "spawn:noctalia msg panel-toggle launcher";
    };
  };
};
```

The portal lives in [a separate repository](https://github.com/noctalia-dev/xdg-desktop-portal-umbriel) and comes
with the NixOS module: enabling Umbriel installs it, configures it as the `xdg.portal` backend, and writes the
portal configuration screencasting needs. You can set `programs.umbriel.portalPackage` to null if you don't want
the portal.

When `settings` is omitted, the Home Manager and hjem modules leave the user path untouched so Umbriel loads its
packaged configuration. Home Manager also accepts a raw TOML string or a path. The hjem module is exported as
`inputs.umbriel.hjemModules.default`.
